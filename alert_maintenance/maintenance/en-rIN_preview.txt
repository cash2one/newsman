"This was the first time."<br /><br />The poisoning, which police suspect was caused by storing cooking oil in a used pesticide container, killed the children so quickly that some died in their parents arms while being taken to hospital.<br /><br />Ram, who was tasked with monitoring the programme, said the headmistress of the school, who has fled, bought the food and the oil in which it was cooked.

Sinha Institute of Social Studies, who led a team to monitor the programme in Bihar in April.<br /><br />The midday meal scheme of giving school pupils a free lunch is the largest such programme in the world. It has been widely lauded as one of the most successful welfare measures in India, home to a quarter of the worlds hungry, because it also boosts school enrolments and helps children to continue studies.<br /><br />For millions of poor families, the lunch is the only full meal their children eat in a day. That encourages them to send them to school, and not keep them home to help with chores.<br /><br />For this reason, despite being poorly managed, the scheme draws a lot of support from non-governmental organisations, rights activists and the United Nations.<br /><br />"We need it. Its one of Indias most well-thought of programs," said Bharathi Ghanashyam, spokeswoman of Akshaya Patra, an NGO that provides school lunches.<br /><br />Still, audit reports have highlighted the continuing failings of the programme, more than a decade after feeding children a cooked meal in schools was mandated by a Supreme Court order.<br /><br />The problems include grain kept in decrepit condition in central warehouses, and then often stored and cooked in poorly-equipped schools by staff with little or no training.<br /><br />NO WARNING<br /><br />P.K.
