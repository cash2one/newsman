I just never knew I could develop the game that I needed to play links golf effectively."</p><p>STRAIGHT BIRDIES</p><p>Mickelson was on the fringes of contention on the front nine but suddenly lit the blue touch paper on his game with birdies at the 13th and 14th.</p><p>The world number five, watched by wife Amy and his children, then delivered a dazzling coup de grace on the 575-yard 17th.</p><p>Mickelson reached the green with two crunching blows, crying 'Go, Baby, Go' as his second shot came to rest on the green, and the title was effectively secured when he two-putted for his sixth birdie of the round.</p><p>While the American was buzzing, Westwood felt deflated after wasting a glorious opportunity to end his wait for a breakthrough major victory at the 62nd attempt.</p><p>Hundreds of British fans started streaming towards the exits with the Englishman on the 17th hole.</p><p>The crowds, who had to contend with the coolest temperatures of the week and winds gusting up to 25mph, cheered patriotically for Westwood early on but the atmosphere fell flat around the turn as their man started to struggle.</p><p>"I didn't play that badly today but the round came apart at the seventh, eighth and ninth," said the 40-year-old. "I found three bunkers and each time the ball was plugged but that is the defence of the golf course.</p><p>"It seems like an over-40 championship now, it seems like you have to be 42 or 43 to win it," he added, referring to the victories by Ernie Els last year and his close friend Darren Clarke in 2011.</p><p>Westwood was particularly irked when he was distracted at the seventh and found sand off the tee.</p><p>"I can't believe you clicked your camera at the top of my back swing," he fumed at a photographer.</p><p>Conditions were difficult for scoring, just as they had been all through the championship, and sub-par rounds were few and far between on Sunday.</p><p>Els finished in a tie for 26th place despite producing the shot of the day when his approach at the 17th bounced straight into the cup for an eagle three.</p><p>($1 = 0.6553 British pounds) (Editing by Ed Osmond)</p></div></div>
