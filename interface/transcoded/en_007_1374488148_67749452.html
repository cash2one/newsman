We planned everything carefully."</p><p>However, Phachara's joy will be short-lived as the daily grind of school life looms large on his horizon.</p><p>"Tomorrow (Monday) is a public holiday and the first thing I need to do is call my friends and catch up on homework," he added after his four-under-par final round 67 took him to 13-under for the tournament.</p><p>Fellow Thai Prom Meesawat, who finished tied for second with Sutijet Kooratanapisan, was simply stunned by the teenager's performance.</p><p>"It is amazing to see a kid play like that. I had a bogey-free round but look at what he did!" Prom said. (Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai; Editing by John O'Brien)</p></div></div>
