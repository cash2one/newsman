[Apple hits three-year low in smartphone marketshare, shipment figures reveal](http://54.251.107.116/transcoded/en_008_1374815520_3489369.html)

    Fresh reports on the state of the cellphone market during Q2 2013 have
    blown through the barn door, and industry analysts are flaunting some fairly
    impressive figures. Smartphones have outsold their less-intelligent brethren
    for the second quarter in a row, and Strategy Analytics says shipments hit
    a record-breaking 237.9 million. According to IDC, Samsung managed to ship
    a total of 72.4 million smartphones during Q2 -- a 43.9% boost year-over-year
    -- with help of the Galaxy S 4and price cuts to the GS3. To put that in
    perspective, that's more than double the 31.2 million iPhones Apple managed to
    ship, and Strategy Analytics claims this marks a three-year low in Cook and
    Co.'s marketshare. While LG and ZTE each occupy third and fifth place,
    respectively, Lenovo pushed Huawei out of the number four slot by sending out
    11.3 million handsets. If you're craving for more stats, hit the break for
    a trio of press releases
